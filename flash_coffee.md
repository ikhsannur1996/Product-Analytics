#### B. Conversion rates based on the provided numbers in each action:
- **App Opens to User Registrations:** 80% conversion rate (100% app opens, 80% registrations)
- **User Registrations to Product Views:** 88% conversion rate (80% registrations, 70% product views)
- **Product Views to Items Added to Cart:** 71.4% conversion rate (70% product views, 50% items added to cart)
- **Items Added to Cart to Orders Completed:** 72% conversion rate (50% items added to cart, 36% orders completed)

### Insights:

1. **Strong Initial Engagement:** The app exhibits a robust initial engagement, with 80% of users who open the app progressing to complete registrations. This indicates a successful initial hook or value proposition that encourages users to sign up.

2. **Funnel Drop-offs:** There's a notable decrease in conversion rates as users move through the stages. The transition from registrations to product views is fairly high at 88%, but a significant drop occurs from product views to adding items to the cart, standing at 71.4%. This suggests potential usability or visibility issues within the app affecting user interactions with products or navigation.

3. **Cart to Completion Rate:** Despite drop-offs earlier in the funnel, the transition from items added to the cart to completed orders stands at 72%. This signals that those who reach the cart stage are quite likely to finalize their purchases. However, there might still be barriers during the checkout process preventing some users from completing orders, such as complicated checkout procedures or unexpected costs.

### Further Analysis for Actionable Insights:

- **Address Funnel Drop-offs:** Investigate and enhance the user experience between product views and adding items to the cart. Improve navigation, product visibility, and ensure intuitive calls-to-action to encourage users to add items to their carts.

- **Optimize Checkout Process:** Analyze the checkout process thoroughly to identify and remove potential barriers. Simplify steps, offer clear and transparent cost breakdowns, and consider options like guest checkouts to streamline the process.

- **Continuous Analysis:** Continuously monitor user behavior within the app, gather feedback, and analyze user interactions at each stage. Data-driven insights can guide decisions for ongoing improvements and optimizations.

By focusing on these areas, the app can potentially enhance the overall user experience, decrease drop-off rates, and ultimately increase the conversion rate from app opens to completed orders.
